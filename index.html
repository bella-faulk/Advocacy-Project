    <h2>About My Topic</h2>
    <p class="spacing-container"> To start learning more about my topic, the issue of climate justice begins with the
      disproportionate effects of climate change on people who have had the least cause of it, such as overall emissions
      or pollution. Although climate change may feel like a newer issue in today's age, in the past there have been
      movements and actions towards preventing it, with a long and interesting history.</p>

    <p class="important" class="spacing-container">Climate justice also addresses how countries who hold the least
      amount of responsibility in causing climate change are already bearing the gravest consequences, and how we can
      mitigate these harmful effects. In order to protect our future from further harm and to achieve climate justice,
      it is essential for us to take action now.</p>

    style="width:800px;height900px;" />

  <p>Floodwaters surround houses in Sohbat Pur City, Pakistan, in August of 2022. The floods of Pakistan during this
    time was the most devastating in its history, with approximately 1.7 million houses destroyed, 1,325 casualties, and
    12,703 people injured. Pakistan only produces a negligible 0.8% of the world's shared emissions, but bares the brunt
    of one of the worst climate emergencies in recent times. </p>

        <p>
          Since 1986, there have been thousands of oil pipelines that have burst and caused irreperable damage to the
          planet, averaging 76,000 barrels per year, or 200 barrels per day. Besides that, pipelines in the United Staes
          can pollute drinking water and disproportionally affect Native and marginalized communities. We urge you to
          join us in the cause to go against the construction of pipelines in the future by signing this petition!
